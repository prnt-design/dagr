# Browser measurements

Two files that measure what a browser costs, which the rest of `bench/` cannot:
`label-throughput.html` drives `@dagr/render`'s HTML overlay in a real browser
and `label-throughput.mjs` opens it, runs a plan and prints the numbers.

**Nothing here is part of `pnpm bench:ci`, and it is not a gate.** The gate
compares Node medians against a committed baseline on one machine; a browser
frame time cannot join it, for the reason M4.10's roadmap entry already gives
about GPU frame times: there is no automated way to re-measure it, even on the
baseline machine. What this directory is for is answering a question once, with
numbers, and writing down how the numbers were taken so somebody can disagree
with them later.

**A harness only counts once it is in the repo.** These files are committed,
and that is the point: a measurement script kept in a scratch directory is
outside `pnpm lint`, outside `pnpm typecheck` and outside review, so every
green gate while it lives there is true and says nothing about it.
`card-heights.mjs` went red on its first lint the moment it was committed,
having "passed" for an entire review cycle from a scratchpad.

## Running it

```
pnpm --filter @dagr/render build          # the page imports from dist
python3 -m http.server 8733               # from the REPO ROOT
node bench/browser/label-throughput.mjs '[{"count":6000,"cap":20000,"zoom":0.387}]'
```

The runner needs `playwright-core` and a Chromium; on the dispatch box that is
`~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1234/chrome-linux64/chrome`, and the path is at
the top of the `.mjs`. Each plan step takes 90 frames, discards the first 30, and
reports medians; one warm-up run happens before the plan, which is the rule
`bench/README.md` already states for a capture.

Plan fields: `count` nodes registered, `cap` the overlay's element cap, `zoom`
(which decides how many of them are on screen), `pan` a multiplier on the two CSS
pixel per frame camera move (0 for a still camera), and `willChange` to promote
the layer.

## What it measures, and what it does not

It reports `syncMedian` (the overlay's own JavaScript, from `performance.now()`
either side of `overlay.sync()`) and `frameMedian` (the interval between
`requestAnimationFrame` callbacks, which is the whole frame: the sync, the style
recalculation, the layout, the paint and the composite).

The labels overlap heavily at the low zooms that put a thousand of them on
screen, which no readable scene would do. That is deliberate: the question is
what a browser costs per element, and the separate question of how many labels
a viewport can hold at readable size is arithmetic, not a measurement (a label
about 100 by 18 CSS pixels tiles a 1200 by 800 viewport 530 times with no gaps
at all, so a real scene shows one or two hundred).

## The numbers this was written for

Taken on 2026-08-14, on the dispatch box (AMD EPYC VM), headless Chromium
through swiftshader with NO GPU, a 1200 by 800 CSS pixel layer at device pixel
ratio 1. Software rasterisation makes the constants pessimistic; the shape of
the curve is what carries.

| Elements attached | `sync` median | Frame, panning | Frame, still | Frame, panning, promoted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 120 | 0.2 ms | 33.3 ms | | |
| 357 | 0.2 ms | 83.3 ms | | 16.7 ms |
| 432 | 0.3 ms | | 16.7 ms | |
| 616 | 0.3 ms | 133.3 ms | | |
| 744 | 0.6 ms | | 16.7 ms | |
| 1073 | 0.5 ms | 216.7 ms | | 83.3 ms |

Every frame figure is a multiple of 16.7 ms because the browser paints on a
vsync tick, so a row is a frame count rather than a time: 83.3 ms is five ticks.
Run to run, a row moves by one tick.

Three things follow, and they are in `docs/docs/render.md` in full.

- **The overlay's own work is not the cost.** `sync()` is 0.2 to 0.6 ms at up to
  a thousand elements, under 4% of a 16.7 ms budget.
- **Holding elements is not the cost either.** 744 elements with a still camera
  hold 60 frames a second.
- **The cost is repainting text under a moving transform**, about 0.2 ms per
  element per frame here, and promoting the layer removes most of it: 357
  elements go from 83.3 ms to 16.7. The overlay still does not set
  `will-change`, because a promoted layer is rasterised once and scaled, so the
  text softens under a zoom. A consumer who pans far more than they zoom can set
  it themselves on the layer, and now knows what it buys.
