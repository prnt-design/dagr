 * bounds ONE event and cannot bound a gesture: {@link wheelZoomFactor} is
 * exponential and exponentials compose exactly, which its docstring rightly
 * calls a feature. Thirty saturated events are an ordinary trackpad fling and
 * multiply the zoom by e^9, about 8100x. **So the RANGE is what stops a fling,
 * and it is the only thing that does.**
 *
 * The values are picked so that neither limit can be mistaken for a broken
 * renderer, which is a claim about this specific scene: `@dagr/render` draws one
 * 100 by 40 world-unit quad, on a stage `styles.css` keeps at least 600 CSS
 * pixels tall. At 12 the visible world is at most 50 world units tall, so the
 * quad's top and bottom edges are both still on screen instead of amber filling
 * the frame. At 0.2 the quad is 20 by 8 CSS pixels, small but unmistakably a
 * rectangle rather than a speck.
 *
 * 0.05 to 60 was the range before, and it produced both failures rather than
 * preventing them: from zoom 3, ten saturated events reach 60, where a 1102 by
 * 598 canvas sees 18 by 10 world units, entirely INSIDE the quad and flat amber
 * edge to edge; the other way lands on 0.05, where the quad is 5 by 2 pixels.
 * See `test/camera-input.test.ts`, which fails on those numbers.
